    <p>
      She is a mechanical engineer by training, but an artist at heart. Her work is shaped by a lifelong attentiveness to form, contrast, and detail—an instinct that first took root in AP Art during high school and never left. With a sharp mind and a keen eye, she naturally identifies artistic concepts in everyday moments, finding balance between precision and expression in all that she does.

      Much of her inspiration comes from walking in nature, where organic patterns, textures, and quiet movement inform her creative process. Ink remains her favorite medium, allowing her to explore depth and spontaneity through deliberate marks. Looking ahead, she hopes to carry her passion for art into her engineering career, using creativity as a bridge between technical problem-solving and human-centered design.
